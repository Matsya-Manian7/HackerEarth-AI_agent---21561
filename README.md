The telemedicine services in India have been significantly growing, with last year’s consultations recorded at 200 million on the eSanjeevani portal alone.Telemedicine has opened many gateways for the people in rural and untapped areas to access diagnosis and healthcare.

Even though telemedicine has been able to give medical solutions to the patients, it lacks the trade-off between the time to diagnosis and the precision to get the right medication with the available resources in that area.

We tend to balance the trade-off by implementing an AI-agentic Workflow powered by SLM (Small-Language Models) which can run on small devices like mobile phones or in custom hardware with minimal computation.

These agents work together to analyze and provide better insights about the patient’s current and past data.They also refer to the demographics of the rural areas common health issues and the availability of medication in their surroundings,helping the telemedicine doctor to make better well-informed decisions based on the data provided.
